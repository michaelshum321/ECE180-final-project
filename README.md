ECE 180 Final Project 

The idea of this project is to see what sort of factors have the most impact on Cryptocurrency prices. 

The two main steps done in this project are to

1. Make a simple webcrawler to grab data from online sources to be used for ML
2. Build a model using the data to determine what affects the prices

For my portion of the project, I decided to do a text analysis on posts in Reddit surrounding events that caused two popular coins, DogeCoin and Garlicoin, to surge in price.
